# ProcessWire Live Templates for PhpStorm

How to:

1) Go to *Preferences | Tools | Settings Repository*

2) Add Read-only Source https://github.com/koomai/phpstorm-laravel-live-templates

3) Restart PhpStorm.

4) To see all templates, go to *Preferences | Live Templates* and expand the Template Group.

It's hard to remember shortcuts when there are a large number of options. A
more efficient way is to take advantage of PhpStorm's *Insert Live Template*
shortcut. Type as few or as many letters as you want and press `Cmd + J`. Then
continue typing to filter the options.
